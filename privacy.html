    <h1>Privacy Policy <span class="pill">ScrollStudio</span></h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: February 8, 2026</p>

    <div class="card">
      <p><strong>Quick summary:</strong> ScrollStudio helps you generate content ideas (hooks, captions, hashtags). We collect only what we need to run the app, improve reliability, and support subscriptions. You control what you type, and you should avoid entering sensitive personal information in prompts.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1) Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>ScrollStudio</strong> (“we,” “us,” “our”) collects, uses, and shares information
      when you use the ScrollStudio mobile application (the “App”).
    </p>

    <h2>2) Information you provide</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Prompts and inputs:</strong> text you enter (e.g., what you’re posting about), plus your selected options like platform, tone, type, and length.</li>
      <li><strong>Saved items (Vault):</strong> content you choose to save in the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Support messages:</strong> if you contact support or submit feedback, we receive the information you send.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) Information collected automatically</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Basic app diagnostics:</strong> crash logs and performance information (to help us fix bugs).</li>
      <li><strong>Device/app metadata:</strong> app version, device type, and operating system version.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage signals:</strong> things like generation counts (for daily limits and reliability).</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="muted">
      Note: The exact diagnostics available can depend on your device settings and Apple platform services.
    </p>

    <h2>4) AI processing and third-party services</h2>
    <p>
      ScrollStudio uses AI services to generate content. To produce outputs, we may send your prompt text and selected settings
      (platform, tone, type, length, emoji preference) to our AI providers.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AI provider:</strong> We may use third-party AI APIs (for example, OpenAI) to generate results.</li>
      <li><strong>What is shared:</strong> your generation request data (prompt + settings) and technical details required to fulfill the request.</li>
      <li><strong>What you should not share:</strong> avoid entering sensitive personal data (e.g., SSNs, passwords, medical data, financial account info).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5) How we use your information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To generate content outputs you request.</li>
      <li>To operate and maintain the App (including enforcing daily generation limits for free plans).</li>
      <li>To personalize your experience (e.g., defaults for platform/type/tone).</li>
      <li>To troubleshoot issues, prevent abuse, and improve reliability and safety.</li>
      <li>To provide customer support and respond to requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6) Subscriptions and payments</h2>
    <p>
      If you purchase a subscription (“Pro”), payments are processed by <strong>Apple</strong> via In-App Purchases.
      We do <strong>not</strong> receive your full payment card details. Apple may provide us limited information such as
      subscription status or purchase identifiers for verification and restore-purchases functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>7) Data storage</h2>
    <p>
      Some data may be stored locally on your device (for example, your settings or saved items), and some data may be stored on our servers
      (for example, generation requests for debugging, abuse prevention, and service reliability).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local storage:</strong> settings like default platform/type/tone may be saved on-device.</li>
      <li><strong>Server storage:</strong> we may store limited logs to maintain the service, enforce limits, and debug issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8) Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain information only as long as necessary to operate the App, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes,
      and enforce agreements. Retention periods can vary depending on the data type and purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>9) Sharing of information</h2>
    <p>We may share information in the following limited situations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> hosting, analytics/diagnostics, and AI providers needed to run the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal and safety:</strong> if required to comply with law, enforce our Terms, or protect users and the public.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets (with appropriate safeguards).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>

    <h2>10) Your choices and controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Prompt content:</strong> you control what you enter—avoid sensitive information.</li>
      <li><strong>Saved items:</strong> you can delete saved items in the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> manage or cancel via Apple ID settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11) Data deletion requests</h2>
    <p>
      You can request deletion of data associated with your use of the App by contacting us at
      <a href="mailto:support@scrollstudio.app">support@scrollstudio.app</a>.
      Include “Data Deletion Request” in the subject line and provide any relevant details to help us locate the data.
    </p>

    <h2>12) Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      ScrollStudio is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
      If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us and we will take appropriate action.
    </p>

    <h2>13) Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect information. However, no method of transmission
      or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>14) International users</h2>
    <p>
      If you access the App from outside the United States, your information may be processed in jurisdictions with different data protection laws.
    </p>

    <h2>15) Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will revise the “Last updated” date at the top.
      Your continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated policy.
    </p>
